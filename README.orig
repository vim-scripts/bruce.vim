This small Python plugin is a translation of the Emacs 'bruce' utility
(formerly known as 'spook'). It adds key words and phrases one might expect in
a e-mail spying program to the end of the current buffer in the form of a
signature, in order to confuse such programs. I didn't write it so much to
make a statement as to relieve boredom for a few minutes, but the issue is
important.

Installation is relatively simple. Copy bruce.vim to global or local plugin
directory. You'll need a data file, ~/.bruce.lines of course, which consists
of special words and phrases, separated by newlines; otherwise Python will
raise an error. I included a good example from Emacs with small changes.

To add a 'bruce' signature to the current buffer, simply type :Bruce in normal
mode. That's all!
